how to run programs expecting standard inputActions for how to run programs expecting standard input	Feb 16, 2017 9:48 AM
Here is a better approach to modify a program that uses standard input so that it reads directly from a file (if supplied as an argument).

Add the following lines at the beginning of the main method:

        // if supplied, this code uses args[0] as standard input
        if (args.length > 0) {
            FileInputStream is = null;
            try {
                is = new FileInputStream(new File(args[0]));
            } catch (Exception ex) {
                System.err.println(ex);
            }
            System.setIn(is);
        }
